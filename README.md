# Spell checker

Makers Academy review

CoGrammar, the reviewer roleplays as a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements. The developer (myself) uses dev process to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application.

## Requirement from the Reviewer

Reviewer works for Megasoftweird who owns a word processor and they would like you to build a spell checker prototype. The spell checker takes in a sentence and outputs the corrected sentence and any incorrect word in the sentence will have a ~ between the incorrect word(s). The spell checker input is always a String format and for now you can implement your own dictionary and the client will provide a dictionary later on.

For example 'This is a tsst' will return 'This is a ~tsst~'

## Feedback

"You have displayed very strong programming skills and your TDD process is quite smooth. There are some refinements to the process that can be made in order to make the process smoother though such as gathering more information about the finer details of the program for example, but generally, your process is really strong."

Other feedback

- Explore more edge cases such as punctuation, proper nouns and numbers
- Could have implemented dictionary earlier
- Can skip some test and create more complex tests earlier on
